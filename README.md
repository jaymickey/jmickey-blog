# Python Blog
Blog platform using python and sqlite3. Bootstrap for design. Currently incomplete.
Eventually it will be used to drive my future blog at jmickey.net.au, the idea being that going to all the effort to create it will give me incentive to actually update it.

# What it uses
* [Python](http://python.org)
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)
* [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) - Simple SQLite3 database
* [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com)
* [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
* A range of flask extentions, see [requirements.txt](https://github.com/jaymickey/jmickey-blog/blob/master/requirements.txt) for information.

# Functionality

Current it can:
* Register/Login/Logout users
* Create/Edit/Delete posts
* Display user profiles + Edit your own profile

What needs work:
* User permission levels
* Pagination
* User management in admin
* Page creation
